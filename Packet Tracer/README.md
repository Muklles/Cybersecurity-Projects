# Packet Tracer Projects

Projects developed using Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and configure computer networks. These projects focus on understanding network protocols, device configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Project Overview

The projects in this folder cover various aspects of networking, including VLAN configuration, subnetting, DHCP, routing, SSH, and network security practices. They demonstrate practical skills in designing, testing, and troubleshooting network topologies.

**What I learned:**
- Configured network devices such as routers, switches, and PCs
- Applied VLANs, IP addressing, and subnetting principles
- Implemented DHCP, SSH, and basic network security measures
- Gained experience in network troubleshooting and simulation
- Developed logical thinking and problem-solving skills in network environments
